## About the experimental context that produced the data

### The original data emanates from:

**Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset - Version 1.0**, by *Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.*, Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory / DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova. / Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy, Email: activityrecognition@smartlab.ws, website: www.smartlab.ws

### The experimental design:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the team captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

For each record was initially provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables (still to be found in the raw data). 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### Pre-processing of the data

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 


## Understanding the variables:

Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

Variable names explicitly derive from the following elements:

1. The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

2. Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ in the raw data). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag in the raw data). 

3. Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag in the raw data. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

4. These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

 - tBodyAcc-XYZ
 - tGravityAcc-XYZ
 - tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
 - tBodyGyro-XYZ
 - tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
 - tBodyAccMag
 - tGravityAccMag
 - tBodyAccJerkMag
 - tBodyGyroMag
 - tBodyGyroJerkMag
 - fBodyAcc-XYZ
 - fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
 - fBodyGyro-XYZ
 - fBodyAccMag
 - fBodyAccJerkMag
 - fBodyGyroMag
 - fBodyGyroJerkMag

5. The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

 - mean(): Mean value
 - std(): Standard deviation
 - meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

6. Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

 - gravityMean
 - tBodyAccMean
 - tBodyAccJerkMean
 - tBodyGyroMean
 - tBodyGyroJerkMean
